module Graphics.UI.Clutter.Actor (
-- * Description

-- | Actor is a base abstract class for all visual elements on the
-- stage. Every object that must appear on the main ClutterStage must
-- also be a ClutterActor, either by using one of the classes provided
-- by Clutter, or by implementing a new ClutterActor subclass.
--
-- Every actor is a 2D surface positioned and optionally transformed
-- in 3D space. The actor is positioned relative to top left corner of
-- it parent with the childs origin being its anchor point (also top
-- left by default).
--
-- The actors 2D surface is contained inside its bounding box,
-- described by the 'ActorBox' structure:
--
-- * Figure 1. Bounding box of an Actor
-- <<file:///home/matt/src/clutterhs/clutter/doc/actor-box.png>>
--
-- The actor box represents the untransformed area occupied by an
-- actor. Each visible actor that has been put on a ClutterStage also
-- has a transformed area, depending on the actual transformations
-- applied to it by the developer (scale, rotation). Tranforms will
-- also be applied to any child actors. Also applied to all actors by
-- the ClutterStage is a perspective transformation. API is provided
-- for both tranformed and untransformed actor geometry information.
--
-- The 'modelview' transform matrix for the actor is constructed from
-- the actor settings by the following order of operations:
--
-- Translation by actor x, y coords,
--
-- Translation by actor depth (z),
--
-- Scaling by scale_x, scale_y,
--
-- Rotation around z axis,
--
-- Rotation around y axis,
--
-- Rotation around x axis,
--
-- Negative translation by anchor point x, y,
--
-- Rectangular Clip is applied (this is not an operation on the matrix
-- as such, but it is done as part of the transform set up).
--
-- An actor can either be explicitly sized and positioned, using the
-- various size and position accessors, like 'actorSetX' or
-- 'actorSetWidth'; or it can have a preferred width and height, which
-- then allows a layout manager to implicitly size and position it by
-- "allocating" an area for an actor. This allows for actors to be
-- manipulate in both a fixed or static parent container
-- (i.e. children of 'Group') and a more automatic or dynamic layout
-- based parent container.
--
-- When accessing the position and size of an actor, the simple
-- accessors like 'actorGetWidth' and 'actorGetX' will return a value
-- depending on whether the actor has been explicitly sized and
-- positioned by the developer or implicitly by the layout manager.
--
-- Depending on whether you are querying an actor or implementing a
-- layout manager, you should either use the simple accessors or use
-- the size negotiation API.
--
-- Clutter actors are also able to receive input events and react to
-- them. Events are handled in the following ways:
--
-- Actors emit pointer events if set reactive, see 'actorSetReactive'
--
-- The stage is always reactive
--
-- Events are handled by connecting signal handlers to the numerous
-- event signal types.
--
-- Event handlers must return @True@ if they handled the event and
-- wish to block the event emission chain, or @False@ if the emission
-- chain must continue
--
-- Keyboard events are emitted if actor has focus, see
-- 'stageSetKeyFocus'
--
-- Motion events (motion, enter, leave) are not emitted if
-- 'setMotionEventsEnabled' is called with @False@. See
-- 'setMotionEventsEnabled' documentation for more information.
--
-- Once emitted, an event emission chain has two phases: capture and
-- bubble. An emitted event starts in the capture phase (see
-- 'capturedEvent') beginning at the stage and traversing every child
-- actor until the event source actor is reached. The emission then
-- enters the bubble phase, traversing back up the chain via parents
-- until it reaches the stage. Any event handler can abort this chain
-- by returning @True@ (meaning "event handled").
--
-- Pointer events will 'pass through' non reactive overlapping actors.

-- Every '?' box in the diagram above is an entry point for application code.

-- For implementing a new custom actor class, please read the
-- corresponding section of the API reference.
