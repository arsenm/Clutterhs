-- These functions are used to connect signals to widgets. They are auto-
-- matically created through HookGenerator.hs which takes a list of possible
-- function signatures that are included in the GTK sources (gtkmarshal.list).
--
-- The object system in the second version of GTK is based on GObject from
-- GLIB. This base class is rather primitive in that it only implements
-- ref and unref methods (and others that are not interesting to us). If
-- the marshall list mentions OBJECT it refers to an instance of this
-- GObject which is automatically wrapped with a ref and unref call.
-- Structures which are not derived from GObject have to be passed as
-- BOXED which gives the signal connect function a possiblity to do the
-- conversion into a proper ForeignPtr type. In special cases the signal
-- connect function use a PTR type which will then be mangled in the
-- user function directly. The latter is needed if a signal delivers a
-- pointer to a string and its length in a separate integer.
